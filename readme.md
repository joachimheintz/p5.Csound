#### p5.Csound

p5.Csound is a lightweight wrapper to the web assembly build of Csound. It provides all the power of Csound inside p5Js sketches. With over a thousand processing opcodes, it is one of the most extensive audio processing libraries available in a browser. This interface provide very little in the way of wrapper functions. In fact, it only procides two. After that vrything is accessible through the Csound object. 

More details on the WASM build of Csound can be found [here](https://github.com/csound/csound/tree/master/wasm/browser).
