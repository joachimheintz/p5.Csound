#### p5.Csound

[Website](https://rorywalsh.github.io/p5.Csound/#/)

p5.Csound is a lightweight wrapper to the web assembly build of Csound. It provides all the power of Csound inside [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketches. With over a thousand signal processing opcodes, it is one of the most extensive audio processing libraries available in a browser. This interface provide very little in the way of wrapper functions. In fact, it only provides two. After that everything is accessible through the Csound object. 

More details on the WASM build of Csound can be found [here](https://github.com/csound/csound/tree/master/wasm/browser).
